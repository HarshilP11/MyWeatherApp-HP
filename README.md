# MyWeatherApp-HP IMPORTANT: The login to my deployed page is the following: Username - Harshil01Test, Password - testing. Also this is the link to the website: HarshilP11.pythonanywhere.com
# To deploy my Django-based Weather Application, I began by creating a PythonAnywhere account and configuring the appropriate Python version for the project. I ensured that all relevant project directories were correctly uploaded using the Bash console. Additionally, I linked my PythonAnywhere workspace to my GitHub repository, allowing the project files to maintain their intended structure. Within the base console, I installed all the necessary dependencies and proceeded to set up a new web application via the PythonAnywhere dashboard. This required modifications to both the WSGI configuration file and the settings.py file to ensure compatibility with the deployment environment. Once the virtual environment was configured and all static files were collected, I was able to successfully access and test the deployed website using the provided URL.
